# Working with Multi-Network Data

```@setup powermodels
import Pkg
using PowerModels

case3file = Pkg.dir(dirname(@__DIR__), "test", "data", "matpower", "case3.m")
```

There are occasions when it is desirable to co-optimize multiple networks, these networks might encode time for dynamic network optimization, or scenarios for stochastic optimization.

To distinguish between network data (see [The Network Data Dictionary](@ref)) that correspond to a single network or to multiple networks, PowerModels.jl provides
```@docs
PowerModels.ismultinetwork
```
For example, we can do the following:
```@example powermodels
network_data = PowerModels.parse_file(case3file)
pm = build_model(network_data, ACPPowerModel, PowerModels.post_opf)

PowerModels.ismultinetwork(pm)
```
PowerModels.jl would generally not read in network data as multi-networks. To generate multiple networks from the same network data, we use the following method
```@docs
PowerModels.replicate
```
For example, we can make three replicates by calling
```@example powermodels
network_data3 = PowerModels.replicate(network_data, 3)
```
Observe that the structure of `network_data3` is different from that of `network_data`, since it is a multi-network. The user can then modify each replicate of the network to vary in the corresponding parameter of interest. See [`test/common.jl`](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModels.jl/blob/master/test/common.jl) for examples on setting up valid Multi-Network data.

To build a PowerModel from a multinetwork data dictionary (see [Building PowerModels from Network Data Dictionaries](@ref)), we supply `multinetwork=true` during the call to `build_generic_model` and replace `post_opf` with `post_mn_opf`,
```@example powermodels
pm3 = PowerModels.build_model(network_data3, ACPPowerModel, PowerModels.post_mn_opf, multinetwork=true)

PowerModels.ismultinetwork(pm3)
```

!!! note

    The `replicate()` method only works on single networks. So
    ```julia
    data33 = PowerModels.replicate(data3, 3)
    ```
    will result in an error. Moreover, `build_model()` (see )

Because this is a common pattern of usage, we provide corresponding calls to `run_mn_opf` (which behaves analogously to `run_opf`, but for multinetwork data).

!!! note

    Working with Multi-Networks is for advanced users, and those who are interested should refer to [`src/prob/test.jl`](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModels.jl/blob/master/src/prob/test.jl) for toy problem formulations for multi-network and multi-conductor models.
