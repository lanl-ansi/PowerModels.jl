## Variable naming scheme

### Power
Defining power $s = p + j \cdot q$ and $sm = |s|$
- s: complex power (VA)
- sm: apparent power (VA)
- p: active power (W)
- q: reactive power (var)

### Voltage
Defining voltage $v = vm \angle va = vr + j \cdot vi$:
- vm: magnitude of (complex) voltage (V)
- va: angle of complex voltage (rad)
- vr: real part of (complex) voltage (V)
- vi: imaginary part of complex voltage (V)

### Current
Defining current $c = cm \angle ca = cr + j \cdot ci$:
- cm: magnitude of (complex) current (A)
- ca: angle of complex current (rad)
- cr: real part of (complex) current (A)
- ci: imaginary part of complex current (A)

### Voltage products
Defining voltage product $w = v_i \cdot v_j$ then
$w = wm \angle wa = wr + j\cdot wi$:
- wm (short for vvm): magnitude of (complex) voltage products (V$^2$)
- wa (short for vva): angle of complex voltage products (rad)
- wr (short for vvr): real part of (complex) voltage products (V$^2$)
- wi (short for vvi): imaginary part of complex voltage products (V$^2$)

### Current products
Defining current product $cc = c_i \cdot c_j$ then
$cc = ccm \angle cca = ccr + j\cdot cci$:
- ccm: magnitude of (complex) current products (A$^2$)
- cca: angle of complex current products (rad)
- ccr: real part of (complex) current products (A$^2$)
- cci: imaginary part of complex current products (A$^2$)
