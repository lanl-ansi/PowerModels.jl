PowerModels.jl Change Log
=================

### Staged
- Added pm.var and made all JuMP variables anonymous (breaking)
- Eliminated usage of pm.model.ext, for details see [#149](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModels.jl/pull/149)
- Made solution default units per-unit (breaking)
- Removed deprecated bus-less constraint_theta_ref function (breaking)
- Moved check_cost_models into the objective building function
- Fixed out of range bug in calc_theta_delta_bounds

### v0.3.4
- Added support for Matpower data with dclines (thanks to @frederikgeth, @hakanergun)
- Added support for QC-OTS
- Added support for multiple reference buses
- Added rectangular voltage formulation of AC-OPF
- Added w-theta formulation of AC-OPF
- Added data units checks to update_data
- Made branch flow parameter names consistent with Matpower
- Fixed bug in constants for w-space phase angle difference constraints
- Fixed bug when no reference bus was specified
- Fixed dcline parsing bug

### v0.3.3
- Added JuMP v0.17 compatibility
- Reorganized documentation into Manual, Library, Developer, and Experimental Results

### v0.3.2
