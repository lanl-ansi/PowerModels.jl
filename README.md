PowerModels.jl is a Julia/JuMP package for Steady-State Power Network Optimization.
It is designed to enable computational evaluation of emerging power network formulations and algorithms in a common platform.
The code is engineered to decouple problem specifications (e.g. Power Flow, Optimal Power Flow, ...) from the power network formulations (e.g. AC, DC-approximation, SOC-relaxation, ...).
This enables the definition of a wide variety of power network formulations and their comparison on common problem specifications.

**Core Problem Specifications**
* Power Flow (pf)
* Optimal Power Flow (opf)
* Optimal Transmission Switching (ots)
* Transmission Network Expansion Planning (tnep)

**Core Network Formulations**
* AC (polar coordinates)
* DC Approximation (polar coordinates)
* SOC Relaxation (W-space)
* QC Relaxation (W+L-space)

**Network Data Formats**
* Matpower ".m" files (see DATA.md for details)

For further information, consult the documentation in the `/docs/src/` folder.
