PowerModels.jl is a Julia/JuMP package for Steady-State Power Network Optimization.
It is designed to enable computational evaluation of emerging power network formulations and algorithms in a common platform.
The code is engineered to decouple problem specifications (e.g. Power Flow, Optimal Power Flow, ...) from the power network formulations (e.g. AC, DC-approximation, SOC-relaxation, ...).
This enables the definition of a wide variety of power network formulations and their comparison on common problem specifications.

**Core Problem Specifications**
* Power Flow (pf)
* Optimal Power Flow (opf)
* Optimal Transmission Switching (ots)
* Transmission Network Expansion Planning (tnep)

**Core Network Formulations**
* AC (polar coordinates)
* DC Approximation (polar coordinates)
* SOC Relaxation (W-space)
* QC Relaxation (W+L-space)

**Network Data Formats**
* Matpower ".m" files (see DATA.md for details)


## Installation

The latest stable release of PowerModels can be installed using the Julia package manager with,

`Pkg.add("PowerModels")`

For the current development version, "checkout" this package with,

`Pkg.checkout("PowerModels")`

At least one solver is required for running PowerModels.  The open-source solver Ipopt is recommended, as it is extremely fast, and can be used to solve a wide variety of the problems and network formulations provided in PowerModels.  The Ipopt solver can be installed via the package manager with,

`Pkg.add("Ipopt")`


## Basic Usage

Once PowerModels is installed, Ipopt is installed, and a network data file (e.g. "nesta\_case3\_lmbd.m") has been acquired, an AC Optimal Power Flow can be executed with,
```
using PowerModels
using Ipopt

run_ac_opf("nesta_case3_lmbd.m", IpoptSolver())
```

Similarly, a DC Optimal Power Flow can be executed with,
```
run_dc_opf("nesta_case3_lmbd.m", IpoptSolver())
```

In fact, "run_ac_opf" and "run_dc_opf" are shorthands for a more general formulation-independent OPF execution, "run_opf".  For example, "run_ac_opf" is,
```
run_opf("nesta_case3_lmbd.m", ACPPowerModel, IpoptSolver())
```

Where "ACPPowerModel" indicates an AC formulation in polar coordinates.  This more generic "run_opf" allows one to solve an OPF problem with any power network formulation implemented in PowerModels.  For example, an SOC Optimal Power Flow can be run with,

```
run_opf("nesta_case3_lmbd.m", SOCWRPowerModel, IpoptSolver())
```

Extending PowerModels with new problems and formulations will be covered in a another tutorial, that is not yet available.


## Frequently Asked Questions

### Modifying Network Data

The following example demonstrates one way to perform multiple PowerModels solves while modify the network data in Julia,

```
network_data = PowerModels.parse_file("nesta_case3_lmbd.m")

run_opf(network_data, ACPPowerModel, IpoptSolver())

network_data["bus"][3]["pd"] = 0.0
network_data["bus"][3]["qd"] = 0.0

run_opf(network_data, ACPPowerModel, IpoptSolver())
```

For additional details about the PowerModels network data structure see the DATA.md file.

### JuMP Model Inspection

The following example demonstrates how to break a `run_opf` call into seperate model building and solving steps.  This allows inspection of the JuMP model created by PowerModels for the AC-OPF problem,
```
pm = build_generic_model("nesta_case3_lmbd.m", ACPPowerModel, PowerModels.post_opf)

print(pm.model)

solve_generic_model(pm, IpoptSolver())
```
